DMA Controller Architecture
===========================

Figure :ref:`Fig-DmaController shows the architecture of the DMA
Controller. It enables a user program to read data from DRAM on the PC
and stream it to user logic in the FPGA and to stream data from user
logic in the FPGA and write it to DRAM on the PC. The user application
on the PC may read or write the data in DRAM.

Up to TBD data channels are supported.
